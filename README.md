# Fitness-project

## Description

This project was done in the course DH2643 Advanced Interaction Programming (7.5Hp). The goal of the project was to create a web application that uses a backend API and a frontend client. The application should be able to create, read, update and delete data from the backend API. The application should also be able to handle user authentication and authorization. The application should be responsive and work on both mobile and desktop.

The website is suppose to be a gym-app application where users can track their progress, their workouts, create workoutplans, get inspiration from over 1300+ exercises from an API and much more. The application is built with React and uses a backend API built with Node.js and Express.js. The application uses a No-SQL database to store data. The application is responsive and works on both mobile and desktop (although it is not optimized for mobile).
